# Storage Image API

This API made in `.NET 8` aims to provide images to be consumed by the [PicLike API](https://github.com/guirdy/pic-like/tree/master/PicLikeAPI) and the [PicLike FrontEnd](https://github.com/guirdy/pic-like/tree/master/picklike-front).

To run the project, it's necessary to execute the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

After the backend is executed, proceed to the next steps in the README of the [PicLike API](https://github.com/guirdy/pic-like/tree/master/PicLikeAPI).
